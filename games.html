    <h1>SOME GAMES TO TRY</h1>

    <h2>CALL OF DUTY</h2>

    <p>
        Call of Duty is the best! It's so cool 
        how you can run around and shoot stuff. My 
        favorite part is when you get to use the big 
        sniper rifle and zoom in super close. It's like 
        you're in a movie, but you get to play it. 
        I always play with my friends, and we try to see 
        who can get the most kills. It's so much fun!

    <h2>FREE FIRE</h2>

    <p>
        Free Fire is the best because it's so easy to 
        play, even on my small phone. The games are 
        super fast, so I can play a bunch of rounds during 
        break time at school. I love getting cool new 
        character skins, and it's awesome when you get a 
        booyah! I always play with my friends, and it's 
        fun to see who can get the most kills. Plus, you 
        get to parachute out of a plane, and that's just 
        so nice!

    <h2>MORTAL KOMBAT</h2>
    <img src="Mortal Kombat Unchained Image.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Mortal Kombat is so cool because you get to do a 
        lot of crazy moves and combos. My favorite part 
        is the Fatalities, they are so funny and gory. I 
        always play as Scorpion because he can throw a 
        rope and pull the other player close. My friends 
        and I always fight each other to see who can get 
        the best moves. It's the best!

    <h2>BURN OUT DOMINATOR</h2>
    <img src="Burn out Dominator.jpg" alt="" height="400">
    <p>
        Burnout Dominator is so fun! It's like, a super fast 
        race, but you get to crash into all the other cars. 
        My favorite part is when you drive really crazy and 
        your boost turns blue, so you can go even faster! 
        It's so cool how you can smash other cars into walls 
        to make a shortcut. And the music is so good! It's 
        the best racing game ever!

    <h2>STREETHD RACING</h2>
    <img src="Street Racing HD.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Street Racing HD is awesome because you get to race with 
        your friends and crash into them! The cars are so 
        cool and you can even make them look the way you want 
        with different paint colors and stickers. I love how 
        you get to drift around corners and get a nitro boost 
        to go super fast! The tracks are amazing, and it's so 
        fun to beat everyone and win the final crown. It's 
        the best!
