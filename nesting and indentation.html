    <h2>NESTING AND INDENTATION</h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, nesting means placing one element inside 
        another. For example, a &ltb&gt tag might be nested 
        within a &ltp&gt tag to make text bold inside a 
        paragraph. Indentation, which uses spaces or tabs, 
        is the practice of moving a line of code to the 
        right. It helps show the hierarchical relationship 
        between the elements, making the code easier to read 
        and understand. Proper indentation makes it clear 
        which elements are nested inside others, even though 
        the browser ignores it. It's a best practice for 
        writing clean, organized code.

    <p>This was the explanation our teacher gave to us!
        Now if you check the codes below, you would see how 
        each one is under another. That's called nesting and
        indentation
